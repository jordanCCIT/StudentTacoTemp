      "# Fat-Poached Carnitas\n* 3 pounds of boneless pork shoulder or uncured picnic ham (see note for how to select).\n* 0.25 to 0.50 cups of liquified fat (oil, lard or duck fat is acceptable)\n* 10 to 15 garlic cloves (roasted preferred)\n* 1 lemon, sliced into thin circles and those are quartered\n* coarse salt\n* black pepper\n\n1. Heat oven to 250 degrees.\n2. Cube pork shoulder in roughly 3-inch chunks.\n3. Salt and pepper the cubes aggressively.\n4. Stuff cubes tightly (very tightly) into the smallest, deepest baking dish available.\n5. Stuff garlic and lemon between the cubes.\n6. Pour fat over cubes to just cover.\n7. Bake in oven for 5 hours.\n8. Remove dish from oven.\n9. Cover a sheet pan with foil.\n10. With slotted spoon, remove the pork to the sheet pan and spread out in a single layer.\n11. Turn on broiler.\n12. Broil pork in sheet pan until it is somewhat blackened and crispy, probably 4-6 minutes. YMMV because broilers are ridiculous.\n13. Remove from oven and tease with fork.\n\n## Notes\n* A nice thick fat cap on the top of the pork is preferable.\n* Ask your butcher to remove any bones.\n* Do not use cured meat.\n",

    name: "Mushroom Wasabi Salad",
    recipe:
      "#Sauted Shitake Mushroom and Wasabi Salad\n\n\n- 1 cup dried shitake mushrooms \n- Splash of soy sauce\n- Splash of red wine vinegar\n- Splash of olive oil\n- Wasabi-covered sesame seeds (available at the local Asian mart. If you can't find it, sub just a smidge of wasabi)\n- Pinch of salt\n\nPlace shitakes in a bowl and cover with warm water. Soak for about 20 minutes or until shitakes are completely rehydrated. Remove mushrooms and squeeze excess water from them. They don't need to be completely dry, but shouldn't be sopping wet.\n\nHeat olive oil over medium-high heat in a small frying pan. Throw in soy sauce and red wine vinegar. How much depends on your taste. I would start with a tablespoon of each and adjust from there. I like the salad to be a bit more acidic so I tend to add a splash more of the red wine vinegar. Sauté mushrooms for a couple of minutes until they are heated through. Season to taste with salt. Adjust soy sauce and red wine vinegar as needed. Before serving, sprinkle a little bit of the wasabi-covered sesame seeds over the mushrooms to impart a little color, crunchiness, and heat. If you are unable to find wasabi-covered sesame seeds, a dab of wasabi and sprinkle of plain sesame seeds should do the trick. \n\nNote: I keep dried shitakes as a staple in my pantry. I love the fact that the water left over after you rehydrate the mushrooms is called mushroom liquor. Mushroom liquor can be used as a substitute for broth or water in many recipes to impart an lovely mushroomy flavor.",

      "Zaatar\n======\n\n_A.k.a. za‘tar, za’atar, zattr, etc._\n\nZaatar is a thyme-based Middle Eastern seasoning that adapts well to tacos. It has a pleasantly dry, faintly sour/bitter flavor. It goes well on savory bases like squash and lamb, and combines with other sour seasonings like lemon juice and radish.\n\nThere are many kinds of zaatar, some quite different; this recipe is representative, not definitive.\n\n* 4 units thyme\n* 2 units oregano\n* 2 units sesame seeds\n* 0–1 unit salt\n* 1 unit sumac (to be found at a Lebanese or Syrian market, or at a yuppie grocery; in a pinch, lemon zest can substitute)\n* Other herbs to taste: fennel pollen, marjoram, cumin, etc.\n* Optional: trace olive oil or lemon juice as a binder (but not if you plan to store it)\n\nToast the sesame seeds. Grind all ingredients together using any method, stopping when the mixture is not too fine to pick up by pinching.\n\nMay be added to meat during cooking, or sprinkled over a finshied taco.\n\nThe latest theories have not ruled out the possibility of a zaatar mole.\n\ntags: vegetarian, vegan\n",
